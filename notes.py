# Question: Which string matches with the regular expression "b\wa+b"?

# "bkaaab"

# The string "bkaab" matches with the regular expression "b\wa+b". The first character must be "b". After this, the symbol \w is used to match any alphanumeric character, including "k". Next, the + symbol specifies that there should be one or more occurrences of the character it follows, which in this case is "a". Finally, the string must end with "b".

>The labs for this course are available when you enroll for the course.

My learning experience are summarized as follows:
>PEP 8 [Python Enhancement Proposal](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

>Basics: [strings, conditionals, functions](basics.py)

>Regular Expressions: [REGEX](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) :
A regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that forms a pattern. You can use these in Python to search for a variety of patterns. This could include IP addresses, emails, or device IDs.
